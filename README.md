# WebProject

The purpose of this project is to have a seed selling and distribution website for small, independent growers. Users can create an account
to add personal information which makes business transactions much easier and faster. The users will be able to search seeds from the "search" function,
or click on a specific category from the home page to browse one of those categories. Users will also be able to write reviews on the
seeds and services, as well as have access to growing tips for a seed or a specific region.
